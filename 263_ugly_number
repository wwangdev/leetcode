Ugly Number

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number. 
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7. 
Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number

Code:

class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if (num == 0)
            return 0;
        int factor[3] = {2, 3, 5};
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
        {
            while (!(num % factor[i]))
                num /= factor[i];
        }
        return num == 1;
    }
};
