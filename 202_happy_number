Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
Example:Â 19 is a happy number
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Code:

class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        map<int, int> m;
        while (n != 1)
        {
            if (m.find(n) != m.end())
                return 0;
            m[n] = 1;
            int temp = 0;
            int t = n;
            while (t)
            {
                temp += (t%10) * (t%10);
                t /= 10;
            }
            n = temp;
        }
        return 1;
    }
};
