Number of Segments in a String 

Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.
Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.
Example:
Input: "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5

Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int countSegments(string s) {
        int prev = 0; // 0 means space, 1 means not space
        int counter = 0;
        for (auto c : s)
        {
            if (c != ' ')
            {
                if (prev)
                    continue;
                else
                {
                    ++counter;
                    prev = 1;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                prev = 0;
            }
                
        }
        return counter;
    }
};
