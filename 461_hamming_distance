The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231. 
Example: 
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        x ^= y; // xor to ge the diff
        // count the bit set in x
        int count = 0;
        while (x)
        {
            x &= (x-1);
            ++count;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
