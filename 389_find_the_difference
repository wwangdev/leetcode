Find the Difference 

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.
Example: 
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

Code:

class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> m;
        for (auto c : t)
            ++m[c];
        for (auto c : s)
            --m[c];
        for (auto &iter : m)
            if (iter.second == 1)
                return iter.first;
        return '0';
    }
};

Better solution: same as find the only one number that doesn't appear twice

class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        char res = 0;
        for (auto c : s)
            res ^= c;
        for (auto c : t)
            res ^= c;
        return res;
    }
};
